# Referencer

## About

_Referencer_ (possibly WIP title) is a [website](https://tirtstan.github.io/Referencer/) that has been designed for me to reference popular media types based on my school's [referencing guide](https://irp.cdn-website.com/271d35b6/files/uploaded/The%20IIE%20Harvard%20Style%20Reference%20Guide%20-%20Adapted%20for%20The%20IIE%202024-f52fbd5a.pdf).

I am also creating this as a means to learn some web dev! It's been _interesting_ so far. Count this as my "first" official project.

## How To Use

<br>You can add as many authors as you like.

### 3. Fill The Rest

<br>You can also leave some of the information out and it will automatically place unknown tags (anon, s.l., s.n., s.a.) in the output!

### 4. Browse And Copy

### 5. Auto Fill

<img src="src/gifs/readme/auto-fill.gif" width="640" height="360" alt="clicking the auto fill button to contact the youtube api"/>

<br>With media types like YouTube, you can use the auto fill button to automatically fill all information about a video as long as there is a link.

## Happy Referencing!
